CEN4345C - Game Development Project

Educational Purposes Only


This game was developed for CEN4345C - Game Development at UNF. The purpose of this project is to understand the intricacies that go into game development for mobile devices, particularly iOS devices. For the scope of this project we have limited the supported devices to an iPad Mini - as this was the best device provided by UNF.

All credit for the sprites created in the game goes to the following site:
